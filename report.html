            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This report presents a detailed analysis of the visual experience and user interface of Lankadeepa.lk, a prominent news website in Sri Lanka. The analysis was performed using <strong>ReimagineWeb</strong>, an AI-powered website feedback platform. Our goal is to identify key areas for improvement in design, accessibility, and user engagement based on the data provided by the tool.</p>

            <h2>1. Headline & Subheadline Analysis</h2>
            <p>The initial impression of a website is largely shaped by its main headline. ReimagineWeb's analysis pointed out several areas for improvement to grab user attention more effectively.</p>

            <p class="summary"><strong>Key Finding:</strong> The headline is clear but lacks "power words" or specific numbers to create urgency or highlight unique benefits, failing to answer the user's key question: "What's in it for me?".</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>2. Website Copy & Content Analysis</h2>
            <p>The overall language, structure, and calls-to-action (CTAs) are critical for converting visitors. The analysis revealed issues with CTA clarity and information overload.</p>

            <p class="summary"><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Call-to-action buttons use generic language (e.g., "E-Paper") instead of action-oriented phrases (e.g., "Read Today's E-Paper"). The page is also very dense, which can overwhelm new users.</p>

            <h2>3. Visual Analytics & Design Elements</h2>

            <p class="summary"><strong>Key Finding:</strong> The tool suggests adding clear, primary CTAs above the fold, personalizing content, and using social proof (like reader counts) to build trust and encourage action.</p>

            <h2>Summary & Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Based on the data from ReimagineWeb, here are our top 3 recommendations to improve Lankadeepa.lk's user experience:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Refine Headlines and CTAs:</strong> Incorporate action-oriented language and specific benefits (e.g., "Get 24/7 Trusted News Instantly" instead of just the brand name).</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Content Hierarchy:</strong> Reduce information density by using collapsible sections, cards, and more white space to guide the user through the content, preventing overwhelm.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Social Proof:</strong> Integrate testimonials, subscriber counts, or trust badges near key action points to build credibility and encourage user engagement.</li>
            </ol>
